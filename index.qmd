:::{#hero-heading}

Data Scientist. Writer. 

`Pursuing a Master of Science (MSc) in Data Science`

I never imagined data would become my creative outlet, but somewhere between a messy spreadsheet and a late-night project, I realised turning chaos into clarity isn't too bad.

My goal is simple: make life easy, learn every day, and show up with intention.
